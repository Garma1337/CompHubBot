This repository contains the source code of the bot used in Competitive Hub Discord server.  
Bot helps with moderation, organizing tournaments, wars.  
The latest feature of the bot introduced Ranked Lobbies format in the server.

The source code of the bot wasn't properly refactored and provided as is.
If you want to create a bot similar to this one I would recommend reading [Discord.js Guide](https://discordjs.guide) and using this repository for inspiration.
